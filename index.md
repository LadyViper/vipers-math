# Viper's Math

I recently started applying for a variety of PhDs, conferences, and jobs, and I realised that every time I’m asked about my research interests or mathematical expertise, my mind goes blank.

The strange thing is: I do know what I’m doing. I have no trouble talking about mathematics over a beer for several hours. And yet, when it comes to formalising these thoughts on a page, I often end up staring at an empty screen.

So this site is my attempt to fix that.

Mind you, dear visitor: I love telling stories. And they sometimes diverge into unexpected places. You might be in for a bumpy and chaotic ride - but one that, I hope, always circles back to mathematics.
