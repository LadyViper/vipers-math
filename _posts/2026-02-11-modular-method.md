title: "Modular method - what is it?"
categories: [my math, introductory]
---

Since I officially started writing my master thesis and will give my first official seminar talk on it, I figured, I might as well try putting my first post about it here. Please take all this with a pinch of salt - I'm only learning this stuff myself, and can only talk about it as well as I understood it myself.

A reasonable question to start with would be: What is this method for? The name itself suggests that it's a tool after all. To put it plainly - it's a method used for proving that some Diophantine equations have no solutions. (A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, for which only integer solutions are of interest (Wikipedia).) It won't help you with functional equations over complex number, nor will it give zou a nice list of solutions to an equation - it only provides a way to look for contradictions in some arithmetic problems. 

One of these problems is my all time favourite: Fermat's Last Theorem. In its classical version it states, that the equation:

$$ x^n + y^n = z^n$$

has no rational solutions for $n \geqslant 3$.

The problem has been solved by Andrew Wiles at the beginning of this century using - yeah, you guessed it! - the modular method. How does it work?

There are a few steps - that may sound simple, but actually, it took matheaticians over 350 years to figure them out, so respect is deserved:

1. Assume your equation has a solution. 
In this case, assume that there is a triplet of integers (a,b,c) that fulfills the equation. We really don't need to know anything more about them - we just assume that they exist. It is called a "putative solution".
2. Build an elliptic curve using the putative solution.
First "cheating" step, as obviously, it's not like just any curve would do. The class of curves that do is called "Frey curves", they need to be chosen specifically for the considered equation, it's not a "one fits all" situation. Moreover, there's no general algorithm for fidning them - according to my thesis advisor, looking for Frey objects is such a nontrivial problem it's basically a separate branch of research. 
Take a minute or two here to appreciate the level of brilliance that was required to make this step in the first place, moving the problem from a very limited world (polynomial equations) to a very rich one, with a giant algebraic and geometric machinery attached: elliptic curves.
