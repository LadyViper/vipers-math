The vice-commander turned towards us.

“Alright, listen up. We’re short on people today, so we need to divide our forces. Two of you at the end of the crowd, two with me at the beginning, and the rest goes in the middle.”

This made me scratch my head.

“Excuse me,” I asked, “but how do we find the middle?”

For context: in some parts of Germany there’s a tradition called Martinszug. Roughly speaking, a crowd of children aged four to eight gathers with their parents and walks through the city holding lanterns, led by a guy on a horse. The whole thing ends with a big campfire, which is why voluntary firefighters are present — among other things, we also help with crowd control.

Back to the discussion. A comrade turned to me.

“What kind of question is that? There’s the beginning, the middle, and the end.”

“Sure,” I said. “But we’re dealing with a crowd that keeps growing. We can’t count it while standing inside it. Its length changes constantly as people join or drop out. Even if we wanted a rough estimate, we don’t have a drone view of the street. So what does ‘the middle’ actually mean here?”

He looked at me as if I had just knocked over the Christmas tree.

“Good God,” he said. “Mathematicians are useless.”
